Hi! My name is Chloe, I'm an exchange student from Dublin, Ireland. I'm studying Computer Science and so I have a bit of experience with different programming languages, but I'd say I'm most comfortable with C and Python. I've also used Java, HTML, CSS, SQL and JavaScript in previous projects, and I've worked on Linux in previous models too, but for anything that I'm out of practice for, I'll do my best to catch up as we go along. :D

I'm familiar with working as a team and I'm easy to adapt with different people so hopefully we will get along well! I've had a few past projects here and there - some for modules back home and also personal ones I've worked on with my friends (like mini-games and different web apps). I do have some experience in using GitHub but I'm not too consistent with it, but working in a group project I'd be happy to communicate and dedicate my time. Looking forward to work with you! :)
